<p>Thinkful (www.thinkful.com) capstone server-side portfolio project - an online journal of tea tasting experiences.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Aficionado is a way to record each individual tasting of gourmet teas to track favorites and help you develop your palate over time. While this focuses primarily on tea, later iterations will include options to record other experiences such as wine or chocolate and perhaps even a customizable log. Tracking your tea tasting experiences is the most effective way to develop your ability to discern the differences in fine teas and while such journals are available in paper and online, all online options I've found are completely public. I would prefer to make my notes private. Wine is perhaps better known for tastings by connoisseurs but the goal of Aficionado is to make tracking any experience easy and customizable. </p>
